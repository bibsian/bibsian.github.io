      <title>The Normal Equation: Part 1 - Formulating the Cost Function</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve never found a blog post that truly made me understand how to derive the normal equation. I think a reason for this is lot of authors have their own perspective on the problem, leading to a mental image I can&amp;rsquo;t quite grasp onto. But having grabbled with linear algebra for a bit, I think I&amp;rsquo;m ready to try my hand at writing a series of posts that helps someone like my former self understand such an equation.</description>

      <description> This is less of a post and more of a quick cheat sheet for when I&amp;rsquo;m working on stuff.
Secure copy - scp Copying files from local to remote servers # I load my remote LOGIN &amp;amp; HOME dir in my ~/.bashrc # i.e. scp -r &amp;lt;path-to-file&amp;gt; &amp;#34;$JETSON_LOGIN:$JETSON_HOME/subdirectory&amp;#34; scp -r /local/file &amp;lt;host_login_name&amp;gt;@&amp;lt;host_ip&amp;gt;:/remote/directory/</description>

      <title>Running Jupyter Notebooks on the Jetson Nano (via https)</title>
      <link>https://bibsian.github.io/posts/jupyter-setup/</link>

      <description>Today we&amp;rsquo;re going to configure Jupyter notebooks so we can connect to our Nano over https. Note, this same logic could easily be applied to a server in the cloud.
Prereqs/Assumptions  You will be doing this for Python3
 You already have your default python3 configured for virtualenvs
 You have created a virtualenv that we&amp;rsquo;ll install Jupyter &amp;amp; the Ipython kernel on.
 We&amp;rsquo;re doing this setup while we are sshed into the Nano (ssh &amp;lt;jetson name&amp;gt;@&amp;lt;jetson_ip&amp;gt;)</description>

      <title>Installing OpenCV from Source for Python3 on the Jetson Nano</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m starting this post with a short story. I wanted to collect some image data from my Jetson Nano with the Raspberry Pi Camera so I logged into the Nano with ssh, activated my virtual environment ( which has Pytorch installed), opened python and did import cv2&amp;hellip; lo and behold I got a ModuleNotFoundError: No module named &#39;cv2&#39;. For a moment I was perplexed since I know that the Nano comes with OpenCV preinstalled for Python 2 &amp;amp; 3 but then I realized that dam virtual environment ruined me.</description>

      <description>Background If you&amp;rsquo;ve never heard of Nvidia&amp;rsquo;s Jetson Nano you can think of it as a Raspberry Pi with a built-in GPU; their developer community page has some pretty interesting projects if you&amp;rsquo;d like to learn more.
Now, you&amp;rsquo;re only going to get some milage out of the rest of this post if you&amp;rsquo;ve already setup your Jetson Nano hardware. I set mine up to use the barrel jack for a power source, added a wifi card to the board, and connected it to the Raspberry Pi camera (to collect training data and use for real-time inference).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a data scientist who likes to build things, learn, and share my knowledge with others.
Up until now I&amp;rsquo;ve heavily invested in developing my full stack skills but now I&amp;rsquo;m embarking on a journey to dive deep with deep learning ( in particular computer vision and text-to-speech). In order to document my learnings along the way I created this site; hopefully, you&amp;rsquo;ll find a post that helps you grok a concept or extend your thinking and perspective.</description>
